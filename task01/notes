# file baz -> find out it's xz
# rename it to baz.xz so unxz likes it
# file baz again to find out it's something that has MBR on it
# MBR metadata looks broken - literally only zeroes at the beginning
# no jump instruction
# the 55a is there tho
# just realised maybe I should actually just use parted instead of
# acting like an interpreter for the MBR by looking at wiki
# wow it actually works
# has raid flag (?)
# normal mount doesn't work, will try as loop device or whatever it's called
# doesn't work, will try to add eb63 jump instruction
# still doesn't work
# there is no FS - probably the reason it won't mount
# viewing file on the non-patched thing reads some metadata about -
# it's id is a RAID (as parted also indicates)
08.10 - TIME IS 16:52 - going to sleep for a bit
08.10 - TIME IS 18:42 - reading about RAID
# general googling; trying out fdisk -l for more info
# found something about an app "testdisk"
# trying it out but it seems complicated
# will try manual approaches before learning to use it
# trying to make a table that matches this description
# and then fit it to the data from the original image
# am stuck, maybe I need to know about RAID to be
# able to solve this
08.10 TIME IS 19:33 - don't know what to do, maybe read about RAID
