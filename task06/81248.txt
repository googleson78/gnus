Work time: ~40m

After Velin mentioned that ntp would be very hard to understand I decided to
look into it and opened up the rfc (5905) for the newest version of it (ntpv4).
I read the abstract and the intro sections and then started to skim through it
to get a general idea of what I should learn about. At some point I saw the
following phrase:

    "..The selection algorithm operates to find an intersection interval containing a
    majority clique of truechimers using Byzantine agreement principles
    originally proposed by Marzullo.."

..at which point I decided that I did not really want to learn about all this
stuff right now. 

This ASCII art also helped demotivate me and at the same time I find it
amusing so I decided to share it:

             +-----                       -----+^1/2
             |        n-1                      |
             |        ---                      |
             |   1    \                     2  |
     psi_s = | ---- * /  (theta_s - theta_j)   |
             |  n-1   ---                      |
             |        j=1                      |
             +-----                       -----+

Onto the task itself:
Opened up romeo; apt-cache searched for ntp and after filtering a bit
installed the "ntp" package. Checked /etc/ for any config files beginning
with ntp and found ntp.conf. It seemed configured with working servers -
I could ping them. I checked the status of the service and it was apparently
running and fine.

I ran a "dpkg -L ntp | less" to see what else it had installed. I found some 
other stuff like ntpq which I did not know how to use, ntpsweep which I did 
not know how to use and ntptime which was simple enough to use.
