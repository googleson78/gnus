Total work time: ~10 minutes

I booted my PC, at the grub2 menu I pressed 'e' in order to edit the config I
wanted to boot I added init=/bin/bash after the linux (kernel) entry, 
it booted me into a bash, I opened the mount man page and looked up 
the word remount, I found the remount option and I remounted my root fs 
to the "/" directory but with rw permissions, I changed my password using passwd.

I could not however boot the PC off afterwards getting the following string
as an error message: 
"WARNING: could not determine runlevel - doing soft poweroff
  (it's better to use shutdown instead of poweroff from the command line)
shutdown: /dev/initctl: No such file or directory
init: /dev/initctl: No such file or directory"

Afterwards I read up about it in the following SE answer:
