briefly read up on daemons from wikipedia
read up on "daemon" (1) and "daemonize" (1)
create a vbox with debian stable on it
check whether I can use ghc and stack and cabal-install on debian stable - I think it requires backports
search for "communicating with a daemon" and open a couple of tabs
search for "unix socket tldp"
open man socket - find man unix for local sockets
nothing on TLDP for sockets in sections "guides" and "howtos" :(
perhaps consider signals instead as my app is quite simple
this page seems helpful for more basic info regarding daemons - http://www.netzmafia.de/skripten/unix/linux-daemon-howto.html
another one - http://www.itp.uzh.ch/~dpotter/howto/daemonize
oh look, a haskell lib - https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hdaemonize-0.5.4/docs/System-Posix-Daemonize.html
found a book - "Advanced programming in the Unix environment"
another haskell lib - https://hackage.haskell.org/package/daemons
"man 7 unix", "man 3 daemon"
pause       - 16:00
resume      - 16:30
will need to read up on monads and IO after all; brb
pause/end   - 16:40

open up man rsyslog.conf (5) and rsyslogd (8) to read them
as well as the presentation on logging from GNUS
pause       -  16:50 //ah the laziness
