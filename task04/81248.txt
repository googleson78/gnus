Total worktime: 5-6hrs

I began by either copying over my current .config file (which I made around a
year ago) or (don't really rememberby just using the vanilla kernel config
(which doesn't really matter since I went through all the options anyway).

I mostly cut out stuff and added a few things that were weirdly missing.
Amongst the more interesting stuff I cut out was -
- process namespacing support, which I am still unsure as to what it's use case
is, because it normally seems like something that would break my system
- swap memory support
- cgroups (which I will probably have to reenable)
- initramfs support (my system didn't break! I think it's because I initially
  used the initramfs because I needed to mount my /var and /tmp partitions
  (which I have since merged into the / partition))
- support for modules (didn't have any anyway so..)
- a lot of debugging features for a lot of different stuff (gcc, block layer,
  kernel debugging, some other stuff)
- I disabled all the schedulers that were enabled except for the one that is
  selected (not sure if this affects the system at all?)
- removed MBR support, seeing as how I'm using GPT
- disabled support for some features related to overheating and safety (which
  I should probably reenable :D)
- disabled a lot of net stuff that I am unsure if I actually need?

Device drivers were awful as I had to go through a lot of stuff that mostly
didn't concern my system at all. Stuff like:
- parallel ports and the sort which I don't quite know about?
- some serial ports which I left on because I am unsure if something inside my
  laptop actually uses serial ports (?!?)
- I disabled something called /dev/kmem, which I actually tried to cat prior
  to disabling - it froze my system. Maybe we could talk about what this thing
  is?
- I disabled the watchdog support - personally found the way this watchdog
  thing is implemented funny - let's just write to a file and then check it so
  we know the system hasn't crashed :D
- I somehow did NOT have ext2 support on (maybe this was vanilla after all?)
  even though my /boot partition is on an ext2 FS
- I also somehow did NOT have usb 3.0 support although I think my port worked
  fine (and not slower than it should?)

Misc. stuff:
- found out you can disable support for various archiving methods such as xz
  (which I disabled)

My final image was a grand total of 4.2M (which is 2.5M less than my previous
one, hooray for non-functioning stuff in the new image).

Very time-consuming, as usual if you want to actually check out all the
settings. Pretty sure if I was more educated I could cut off much more stuff.
